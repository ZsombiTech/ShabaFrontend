# ShabaFrontend

SHABA is social media platform where people can share their project ideas and other developers or just everyday people can rate the idea. The purpose of the app is to give a feedback about the demand and the originality before actually accomplishing the idea.

The platform uses React as a frontend with Tailwind CSS and React Bootstrap, while the backend is written in Node JS with Express. Furthermore, the database is MondgoDB and I'm planning to add Docker to the project too.

This repo contains the frontend part of the platform.

For now, you have to set up the project locally in order to enjoy it because Github Pages haven't worked yet for me.
I am working on the issue, but until then I apologize for the inconvenience.
